## APP DESIGN
This app contains total 2 screens:
- main view with a table of currencies according to selected table type (main currencies, additional currencies and exchange rates). User can scroll data and manually refresh it by pulling down.</br>
- second screen with a detailed view of selected currency in the specific time period (that could be changed). </br>
The user is able to manually refresh data and set a new range of data. </br>

## DETAIL VIEW
A detail view is a screen where users can check the price of the currency in a specific range of dates. </br>
The maximum range length that is mentioned in API is 93 days so this app also allows a max range of 93 days to be selected. </br>
It's worth mentioning that bigger ranges also work this app is made according to API documentation. </br>
The range can be changed by pressing a floating button with a calendar icon. </br>
On the right side of the navigation controller is a button that allows the user to manually refresh data. </br>

Users can go to details about selected currency just by pressing it. </bd>
However for some data (additional currencies) there is no details. To prevent crashes users can't go into detail about this currency and special information is being shown. </br>

## INVALID RANGES
Users can set an invalid range. </br> </br>

The app must check if the selected range is valid and if not use the last valid range. </br>
In case the user chooses the wrong range special information is being shown that describes what has gone wrong. </br>
Valid range rules:
- the first date must be earlier than the second date
- non of dates can be after the current date
- single range cannot be larger than 93 days

What happens when the user choose the wrong range: </br>

### Dates cannot be in future becasue there is no data:

### Max range is 93 days:

### First date must be before second:
